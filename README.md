- Dev Build
- Local Build
- HMR: Hot Module Replacement (meaning whenever any file gets changed, parcel keeps a track and lively it reloads the file and deploys)
- This uses File Watcher Algorithm internally to keep track of files. And its written in C++
- Caching the build. - Faster builds.
- IMAGE Optimization. Bundle all the files and minify the files as well
- Compressing
- Error Handling
- Deploy in HTTPS
- Tree Shaking : Removes code which aren't used in Code.
- Lazy load
- Create DEV PROD builds separately
